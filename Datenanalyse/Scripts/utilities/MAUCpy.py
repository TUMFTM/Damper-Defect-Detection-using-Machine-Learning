    MAUCpy
    ~~~~~~

    Contains two equations from Hand and Till's 2001 paper on a multi-class
    approach to the AUC. The a_value() function is the probabilistic approximation
    of the AUC found in equation 3, while MAUC() is the pairwise averaging of this
    value for each of the classes. This is equation 7 in their paper.

    Approximates the AUC by the method described in Hand and Till 2001,
    equation 3.

    NB: The class labels should be in the set [0,n-1] where n = # of classes.
    The class probability should be at the index of its label in the
    probability list.

    I.e. With 3 classes the labels should be 0, 1, 2. The class probability
    for class '1' will be found in index 1 in the class probability list
    wrapped inside the zipped list with the labels.
